# Jackbox Party Crasher

This program quickly tries random 4 character long codes as Jackbox.tv codes to attempt to join random games. 

### Requirements
You should only need to have pyautogui installed through pip assuming you have the necessary tools to run Python programs. 

In addition, this program has a vocal countdown that's narrated by the system voice but it is using os and the "say" command for MacOS. You may wish to remove that functionality completely (though I recommend leaving at least the time buffer) or change it to work with your operating system.

I'll provide more information soon.

Please note that I am not in any way associated with Jackbox Games.
